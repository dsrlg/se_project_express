# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing
Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
### Technologoies and techniques
 learned the back-end withfollowing technologies and techniques .

Server-side engineering with Node.js
Instead of just running JavaScript in the browser (front-end), Node.js lets you run JavaScript on the server (back-end).
Express.js
Express.js a framework that makes building web servers much easier.


Building a REST API
A REST API is like a menu system.
That helps how to place an order (HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)


GET /menu → "Show me all available"
POST /orders → "I want to place a new order"
PUT /orders/123 → "I want to modify order #123"
DELETE /orders/123 → "Cancel order #123"

Databases
A database is like storage system. It's where you:

Store data safely,Keep track of what you have,Organize everything so you can find it quickly,Make sure nothing gets lost

Error handling
Error handling is like having a good crisis management plan, that helps track any issues unexpected errors customer might run into and and to handle them
